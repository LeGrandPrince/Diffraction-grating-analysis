# Diffraction grating analysis

Repository, up to date, consists of two python scripts. 

First, the Bloch-Floquet-mode finds Bloch-Floquet refractive indices and calculates diffraction mode regions for various DC. This file is scripted for SHALLOW ETCH GRATING.

Second - sweep calculates Scattering efficiency of grating, its Directionality and Coupling efficiency. Field overlap, up to date, has to be provided externally. 

# Use of the Bloch-Floquet mode script
